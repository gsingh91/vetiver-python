# Vetiver

The goal of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the modelâ€™s input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint. You can use vetiver with:

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/)
- [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)
